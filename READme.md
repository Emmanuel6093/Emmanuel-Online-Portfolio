# How did I complete this assignment?
Once I created my HTML file, I started by creating the head, and making sure everything was linking correctly. After that I created my header with my button and nav links. I made sure that the nav links displayed correctly and I added classes to the nav links. Then I created the introduction which contained my "logo"/picture of my avatar and my name. I added classes to both of those, then I continued to create the about me section which conatined classes as well, info about myself, and a picture of myself too. After that I created my work section containing work that I have done in the past, those also got classes to style, and alt attributes too. Finally I created the footer section which contains info how to reach out and contact me and I put social icons with animations. Moving on to the css styling part I targeted each class element I created and styled it. I also created a hamburger button which would open my nav links and for that I created a Javascript file with a addEventListener. At the end I made sure that all the nav links worked, contact icons worked, and that the elements behaved the way they should.
